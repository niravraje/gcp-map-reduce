        "he already knew that le loutre was quite capable of using force to drive",
        "the acadians from their thriving farms to make new homes for themselves",
        "on french soil rather than that they should pledge their word to the",
        "english again even though that pledge might be broken as before and",
        "there was evidently some scheme more serious in process of hatching than",

        "without the strong grandson to help him and margot ah it was too",
        "bitter in spite of himself gabriel covered his eyes with his hand as if",
        "to shut out the frightful vision",

        "under pretense of trading in furs a french vessel had brought to acadie",
        "guns and ammunition enough to arm both acadians and indians and the",
        "latter were already being secretly bribed by the intendant at louisburg",
        "through le loutre for a signal act of treachery was now required of",
        "them",
        "but the priest had triumphed too soon when at length gabriel raised his",
        "head though his young face looked almost ghostly in the dying light",
        "his eyes were shining with high resolve not that the path of duty was",
        "as yet perfectly clear before him or that he knew whither it might",
        "lead but he was resolute to take no other nevertheless he understood",
        "that mere defiance would not help either himself or those far dearer",
        "than self therefore he controlled himself and said quietly",
        "m labb has without doubt heard of that prtre from the new",
        "england who instructs a flock outside the walls of halifax",
        "le loutre scowled darkly",
        "art thou a heretic already i feared as much",
        "no m labb replied the boy in the same restrained tones yet i",
        "confess that the faith of my fathers holds much of interest for me and",
        "he is good monsieur oh good like our own beloved cur",
        "here he hesitated then took courage and went on rapidly",
        "he bade me always to remember even if i should not in the end turn to",
        "my fathers faith that one of its noblest commands is never do evil",
        "that good may come also that my father obeyed that command o mon",

        "heart as i but who hates the english as my blood will not let me do",
        "and to whom the holy catholic church is the only church",
        "for a moment it seemed as though the priest would strike the pleading",
        "face upturned to his so fierce a flame of wrath swept over him but",
        "instead he said with a sneer",
        "and thou wouldst thrust the words of a heretic down the throat of a",
        "priest of god and the king there is but one explanation boy thou art",
        "a coward",
        "the hot blood surged into gabriels cheeks all his prudence was tossed",
        "aside beneath the lash of that tongue flinging back his head he",
        "confronted le loutre with an air which compelled as it never had failed",
        "to do the reluctant admiration of the man to whom courage seemed the",
        "best of gods gifts to mortals",
        "m labb said the boy in the low tones of an unbending resolve",
        "i am no coward but i should be both coward and liar were i to do your",
        "bidding",
        "for a breathing space the two pairs of eyes held one another like",

        "as thou wilt rejoined the priest coldly but forget not that no",
        "traitors to god and the king can dwell at ease in acadie mine are no",
        "empty threats",

        "stepped out of the surrounding gloom the pine torches carried by them",
        "illuminated their ferocious countenances margot sprang forward and cast",
        "herself upon her knees before the priest",

        "penance that seems unto you good but spare oh spare my cousin if",
        "only for the sake of the granpre",
