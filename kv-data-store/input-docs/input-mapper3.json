        "visible motion this is changed into energy of position when a stone",
        "is projected upwards above the earth or to take a case precisely",
        "similar when a planet or a comet goes from perihelion or its position",

        "various points of this orbit because there would be no change in its",
        "distance from the centre of attraction and therefore no transmutation",
        "of energy",
        "122 we have already arts 108 109 said that the energy in an",
        "oscillating or vibrating body is alternately that of actual motion and",
        "that of position in this respect therefore a pendulum is similar to",
        "a comet or heavenly body with an elliptical orbit nevertheless the",
        "change of energy is generally more complete in a pendulum or vibrating",
        "body than it is in a heavenly body for in a pendulum when at its",

        "ice both colder than the freezing point may be melted by friction",
        "in percussion again we have the energy of the blow converted into",
        "heat while in the case of a meteor or cannon ball passing through the",

        "wooden planks or by the sand to the motion of the ball we may even",
        "generalize still further and assert that whenever the visible momentum",
        "of a body is transferred to a larger mass there is at the same time",
        "the conversion of visible energy into heat",
        "124 a little explanation will be required to make this point clear",
        "the third law of motion tells us that action and reaction are equal and",
        "opposite so that when two bodies come into collision the forces at",
        "work generate equal and opposite quantities of momentum we shall best",
        "see the meaning of this law by a numerical example bearing in mind",
        "that momentum means the product of mass into velocity",
        "for instance let us suppose that an inelastic body of mass 10 and",
        "velocity 20 strikes directly another inelastic body of mass 15 and",
        "velocity 15 the direction of both motions being the same",
        "now it is well known that the united mass will after impact be",
        "moving with the velocity 17 what then has been the influence of the",
        "forces developed by collision the body of greater velocity had before",
        "impact a momentum 10  20  200 while its momentum after impact is",
        "only 10  17  170 it has therefore suffered a loss of 30 units as",
        "regards momentum or we may consider that a momentum of 30 units has",
        "been impressed upon it in an opposite direction to its previous motion",
        "on the other hand the body of smaller velocity had before impact a",
        "momentum 15  15  225 while after impact it has 15  17  255 units",
        "so that its momentum has been increased by 30 units in its previous",
        "direction",
        "the force of impact has therefore generated 30 units of momentum in two",
        "opposite directions so that taking account of direction the momentum",
        "of the system is the same before and after impact for before impact we",
        "had a momentum of 10  20  15  15  425 while after it we have the",
        "united mass 25 moving with the velocity 17 giving the momentum 425 as",
        "before",
        "125 but while the momentum is the same before and after impact the",
        "visible energy of the moving mass is undoubtedly less after impact",
        "than before it to see this we have only to turn to the expression",
        "of art 28 from which we find that the energy before impact was as",
        "followsenergy in kilogrammetres  m v19  6  10  20  15",
        " 15196  376 nearly while that after impact  25  17196",
        "368 nearly",
        "126 the loss of energy will be still more manifest if we suppose an",
        "inelastic body in motion to strike against a similar body at rest thus",
        "if we have a body of mass 20 and velocity 20 striking against one of",
        "equal mass but at rest the velocity of the double mass after impact",
        "will obviously be only 10 but as regards energy that before impact",
        "will be 20  20196  6 while that after impact will be",
        "40  10196  6 or only half the former",
        "127 thus there is in all such cases an apparent loss of visible",
        "energy while at the same time there is the production of heat on",
        "account of the blow which takes place if however the substances that",
        "come together be perfectly elastic which no substance is the visible",
        "energy after impact will be the same as that before and in this case",
        "there will be no conversion into heat this however is an extreme",
        "supposition and inasmuch as no substance is perfectly elastic we",
        "have in all cases of collision a greater or less conversion of visible",
        "motion into heat",
        "128 we have spoken art 122 about the change of energy in an",
        "oscillating or vibrating body as if it were entirely one of actual",
        "energy into energy of position and the reverse",
        "but even here in each oscillation or vibration there is a greater",
        "or less conversion of visible energy into heat let us for instance",
        "take a pendulum and in order to make the circumstances as favourable",
        "as possible let it swing on a knife edge and in vacuo in this case",
        "there will be a slight but constant friction of the knife edge against",
        "the plane on which it rests and though the pendulum may continue to",
        "swing for hours yet it will ultimately come to rest",
        "and again it is impossible to make a vacuum so perfect that there is",
        "absolutely no air surrounding the pendulum so that part of the motion",
        "of the pendulum will always be carried off by the residual air of the",
        "vacuum in which it swings",
        "129 now something similar happens in that vibratory motion which",
        "constitutes sound thus when a bell is in vibration part of the",
        "energy of the vibration is carried off by the surrounding air and it",
        "is in virtue of this that we hear the sound of the bell but even if",
        "there were no air the bell would not go on vibrating for ever for",
        "there is in all bodies a greater or less amount of internal viscosity",
        "a property which prevents perfect freedom of vibration and which",
        "ultimately converts vibrations into heat",
        "a vibrating bell is thus very much in the same position as an",
        "oscillating pendulum for in both part of the energy is given off to",
        "the air and in both there is unavoidable frictionin the one taking",
        "the shape of internal viscosity and in the other that of friction of",
        "the knife edge against the plane on which it rests",
        "130 in both these cases too that portion of the energy which goes",
        "into the air takes ultimately the shape of heat the oscillating",
        "pendulum communicates a motion to the air and this motion ultimately",
        "heats the air the vibrating bell or musical instrument in like",
        "manner communicates part of its energy to the air this communicated",
        "energy first of all moves through the air with the wellknown velocity",
        "of sound but during its progress it too no doubt becomes partly",
        "converted into heat ultimately it is transmitted by the air to other",
        "bodies and by means of their internal viscosity is sooner or later",
        "converted into heat thus we see that heat is the form of energy into",
        "which all visible terrestrial motion whether it be rectilinear or",
        "oscillatory or vibratory is ultimately changed",
        "131 in the case of a body in visible rectilinear motion on the earths",
        "surface this change takes place very soonif the motion be rotatory",
        "such as that of a heavy revolving top it may perhaps continue longer",
        "before it is ultimately stopped by means of the surrounding air and",
        "by friction of the pivot if it be oscillatory as in the pendulum or",
        "vibratory as in a musical instrument we have seen that the air and",
        "internal friction are at work in one shape or another to carry it",
        "off and will ultimately succeed in converting it into heat",
        "132 but it may be said why consider a body moving on the earths",
        "surface why not consider the motion of the earth itself will this",
        "also ultimately take the shape of heat",
        "no doubt it is more difficult to trace the conversion in such a case",
        "inasmuch as it is not proceeding at a sensible rate before our eyes in",
        "other words the very conditions that make the earth habitable and a",
        "fit abode for intelligent beings like ourselves are those which unfit",
        "us to perceive this conversion of energy in the case of the earth yet",
        "we are not without indications that it is actually taking place for",
        "the purpose of exhibiting these we may divide the earths motion into",
        "twoa motion of rotation and one of revolution",
        "133 now with regard to the earths rotation the conversion of the",
        "visible energy of this motion into heat is already well recognized to",
        "understand this we have only to study the nature of the moons action",
        "upon the fluid portions of our globe in the following diagram fig",
        "11 we have an exaggerated representation of this by which we see that",
        "the spherical earth is converted into an elongated oval of which one",
        "extremity always points to the moon the solid body of the earth itself",
        "revolves as usual but nevertheless this fluid protuberance remains",
        "always pointing towards the moon as we see in the figure and hence",
        "the earth rubs against the protuberance as it revolves the friction",
        "produced by this action tends evidently to lessen the rotatory energy",
        "of the earthin other words it acts like a breakand we have just",
        "as by a breakwheel the conversion of visible energy into heat this",
        "was first recognized by mayer and j thomson",
        "illustration fig 11",
        "134 but while there can be no doubt about the fact of such a",
        "conversion going on the only question is regarding its rate of",
        "progress and the time required before it can cause a perceptible",
        "impression upon the rotative energy of the earth",
        "now it is believed by astronomers that they have detected evidence of",
        "such a change for our knowledge of the motions of the sun and moon has",
        "become so exact that not only can we carry forward our calculations so",
        "as to predict an eclipse but also carry them backwards and thus fix",
        "the dates and even the very details of the ancient historical eclipses",
        "if however between those times and the present the earth has lost a",
        "little rotative energy on account of this peculiar action of the moon",
        "then it is evident that the calculated circumstances of the ancient",
        "total eclipse will not quite agree with those actually recorded and by",
        "a comparison of this nature it is believed that we have detected a very",
        "slight falling off in the rotative energy of our earth if we carry out",
        "the argument we shall be driven to the conclusion that the rotative",
        "energy of our globe will on account of the moons action always get",
        "less and less until things are brought into such a state that the",
        "rotation comes to be performed in the same time as the revolution of",
        "the moon so that then the same portion of the terrestrial surface",
        "being always presented to the moon it is evident that there will be no",
        "effort made by the solid substance of the earth to glide from under",
        "the fluid protuberance and there will in consequence be no friction",
        "and no further loss of energy",
        "135 if the fate of the earth be ultimately to turn the same face",
        "always to the moon we have abundant evidence that this very fate has",
        "long since overtaken the moon herself indeed the much stronger effect",
        "of our earth upon the moon has produced this result probably even in",
        "those remote periods when the moon was chiefly fluid and it is a fact",
        "well known not merely to astronomers but to all of us that the moon",
        "nowadays turns always the same face to the earth4 no doubt this fate",
        "has long since overtaken the satellites of jupiter saturn and the",
        "other large planets and there are independent indications that at",
        "least in the case of jupiter the satellites turn always the same face",
        "to their primary",
        "136 to come now to the energy of revolution of the earth in her",
        "orbit round the sun we cannot help believing that there is a material",
        "medium of some kind between the sun and the earth indeed the",
        "undulatory theory of light requires this belief but if we believe in",
        "such a medium it is difficult to imagine that its presence will not",
        "ultimately diminish the motion of revolution of the earth in her orbit",
        "indeed there is a strong scientific probability if not an absolute",
        "certainty that such will be the case there is even some reason to",
        "think that the energy of a comet of small period called enckes",
        "comet is gradually being stopped from this cause in fine there can",
        "be hardly any doubt that the cause is really in operation and will",
        "ultimately affect the motions of the planets and other heavenly bodies",
        "even although its rate of action may be so slow that we are not able to",
        "detect it",
        "we may perhaps generalize by saying that wherever in the universe",
        "there is a differential motion that is to say a motion of one part",
        "of it towards or from another then in virtue of the subtle medium",
        "or cement that binds the various parts of the universe together this",
        "motion is not unattended by something like friction in virtue of which",
        "the differential motion will ultimately disappear while the loss of",
        "energy caused by its disappearance will assume the form of heat",
        "137 there are indeed obscure intimations that a conversion of this",
        "kind is not improbably taking place in the solar system for in the",
        "sun himself we have the matter near the equator by virtue of the",
        "rotation of our luminary carried alternately towards and from the",
        "various planets now it would seem that the sunspots or atmospheric",
        "disturbances of the sun affect particularly his equatorial regions",
        "and have likewise a tendency to attain their maximum size in that",
        "position which is as far away as possible from the influential",
        "planets such as mercury or venus5 so that if venus for instance",
        "were between the earth and the sun there would be few sunspots in the",
        "middle of the suns disc because that would be the part of the sun",
        "nearest venus",
        "but if the planets influence sunspots the action is no doubt",
        "reciprocal and we have much reason to believe that sunspots",
        "influence not only the magnetism but also the meteorology of our",
        "earth so that there are most displays of the aurora borealis as well",
        "as most cyclones in those years when there are most sunspots6 is",
        "it not then possible that in these strange mysterious phenomena we",
        "see traces of the machinery by means of which the differential motion",
        "of the solar system is gradually being changed into heat",
        "138 we have thus seen that visible energy of actual motion is not",
        "unfrequently changed into visible energy of position and that it is",
        "also very often transformed into absorbed heat we have now to state",
        "that it may likewise be transformed into electrical separation",
        "thus when an ordinary electrical machine is in action considerable",
        "labour is spent in turning the handle it is in truth harder to turn",
        "than if no electricity were being producedin other words part of",
        "the energy which is spent upon the machine goes to the production of",
        "electrical separation there are other ways of generating electricity",
        "besides the frictional method if for instance we bring an insulated",
        "conducting plate near the prime conductor of the electrical machine",
        "yet not near enough to cause a spark to pass and if we then touch the",
        "insulated plate we shall find it after contact to be charged with an",
        "electricity the opposite of that in the machine we may then remove it",
        "and make use of this electricity",
        "it requires a little thought to see what labour we have spent in this",
        "process we must bear in mind that by touching the plate we have",
        "carried off the electricity of the same name as that of the machine",
        "so that after touching the insulated plate it is more strongly",
        "attracted to the conductor than it was before when we begin to remove",
        "it therefore it will cost us an effort to do so and the mechanical",
        "energy which we spend in removing it will account for the energy of",
        "electrical separation which we then obtain",
        "139 we may thus make use of a small nucleus of electricity to assist",
        "us in procuring an unlimited supply for in the above process the",
        "electricity of the prime conductor remains unaltered and we may repeat",
        "the operation as often as we like and gather together a very large",
        "quantity of electricity without finally altering the electricity of",
        "the prime conductor but not however without the expenditure of an",
        "equivalent amount of energy in the shape of actual work",
        "140 while as we have seen there is a tendency in all motion to be",
        "changed into heat there is one instance where it is in the first",
        "place at least changed into a current of electricity we allude",
        "to the case where a conducting substance moves in the presence of an",
        "electric current or of a magnet",
        "in art 104 we found that if one coil connected with a battery were",
        "quickly moved into the presence of another coil connected with a",
        "galvanometer an induced current would be generated in the latter coil",
        "and would affect the galvanometer its direction being the reverse of",
        "that passing in the other now an electric current implies energy and",
        "we may therefore conclude that some other form of energy must be spent",
        "or disappear in order to produce the current which is generated in the",
        "coil attached to the galvanometer",
        "again we learn from art 100 that two currents going in opposite",
        "directions repel one another the current generated in the coil",
        "attached to the galvanometer or secondary current will therefore",
        "repel the primary current which is moving towards it this repulsion",
        "will either cause a stoppage of motion or render necessary the",
        "expenditure of energy in order to keep up the motion of this moving",

        "been broken",
        "for instance had the induced current in the case now mentioned been",
        "in the same direction as that of the primary the two currents would",
        "have attracted each other and thus there would have been the creation",
        "of a secondary current implying energy in the coil attached to the",
        "galvanometer along with an increase of the visible energy of motion",
        "of the primary currentthat is to say instead of the creation of",
        "one kind of energy accompanied with the disappearance of another we",
        "should have had the simultaneous creation of both and thus the law of",
        "conservation of energy would have been broken",

        "instances which strengthen our belief in the truth of the great",
        "principle for which we are contending",
        "142 let us next consider what will take place if we cause the primary",
        "current to move from the secondary coil instead of towards it",
        "in this case we know from art 104 that the induced current will be",
        "in the same direction as the primary while we are told by art 100",
        "that the two currents will now attract each other the tendency of this",

        "the second for we learn from art 98 that when a current passes along",
        "a wire its energy is generally spent in heating the wire",

        "experienced and energy will have to be spent upon the process in the",
        "second place an electrical current will be generated in the conductor",
        "and the conductor will be heated in consequence",
        "143 the result will be rendered very prominent if we cause a metallic",
        "top in rapid rotation to spin near two iron poles which by means",
        "of the battery we can suddenly convert into the poles of a powerful",

        "that a magnet resembles an assemblage of electric currents and in the",

        "current of very great strength",
        "146 there is moreover a very great likeness between a",

        "currents and the one which generates statical electricity by means of",

        "the open fields but who have frequently to be dragged back with a very",
        "considerable expenditure of energy so heat will not allow itself to be",
        "confined but will resist any attempt to accumulate it into a limited",
        "space work cannot therefore be gained by such an operation but",
        "must on the contrary be spent upon the process",
        "151 let us now for a moment consider the case of an enclosure in which",

        "temperature to a higher one and that thirdly and finally nothing",
        "in the shape of work can be got out of heat which is all at the same",
        "temperature level",
        "what we have now said enables us to realize the conditions under which",
        "all heat engines work the essential point about such engines is not",
        "the possession of a cylinder or piston or fly wheels or valves",

        "plays in truth the part of an engine as far as energy is concerned",
        "we have here the cold air streaming in over the floor of the room",

        "this weight without limit we may increase the efficiency of our engine",
        "without limit it would thus at first sight appear that by this device",

        "of producing mechanical effect",
        "157 we have thus endeavoured to show under what conditions absorbed",

        "embraces art 110 two varieties of energy one of these being",
        "molecular motion and the other molecular energy of position",
        "let us now therefore endeavour to ascertain under what circumstances",
        "the one of these varieties may be changed into the other it is well",
        "known that it takes a good deal of heat to convert a kilogramme of ice",

        "accomplished the steam produced is not perceptibly hotter than the",
        "boiling water in such cases the heat is said to become latent",
        "now in both these cases but more obviously in the last we may",

        "that instead of increasing the motion of the molecules of water it",
        "has spent its energy in tearing them asunder from each other against",
        "the force of cohesion which binds them together",
        "indeed we know as a matter of fact that the force of cohesion which is",
        "perceptible in boiling water is apparently absent from steam or the",
        "vapour of water because its molecules are too remote from one another",
        "to allow of this force being appreciable we may therefore suppose",
        "that a large part at least of the heat necessary to convert boiling",
        "water into steam is spent in doing work against molecular forces",
        "when the steam is once more condensed into hot water the heat thus",
        "spent reassumes the form of molecular motion and the consequence",
        "is that we require to take away somehow all the latent heat of a",
        "kilogramme of steam before we can convert it into boiling water in",
        "fact if it is difficult and tedious to convert water into steam it is",
        "difficult and tedious to convert steam into water",
        "158 besides the case now mentioned there are other instances in",
        "which no doubt molecular separation becomes gradually changed into",
        "heat motion thus when a piece of glass has been suddenly cooled",
        "its particles have not had time to acquire their proper position and",
        "the consequence is that the whole structure is thrown into a state of",
        "constraint in the course of time such bodies tend to assume a more",
        "stable state and their particles gradually come closer together",
        "it is owing to this cause that the bulb of a thermometer recently blown",
        "gradually contracts and it is no doubt owing to the same cause that a",
        "prince ruperts drop formed by dropping melted glass into water when",
        "broken falls into powder with a kind of explosion it seems probable",
        "that in all such cases these changes are attended with heat and that",

        "separation implied in native sulphur native iron c",
        "then with regard to energy in action we have mainly the following",
        "varieties",
        "1 the energy of air in motion 2 that of water in motion",
        "fuel",
        "197 let us begin first with the energy implied in fuel we can of",
        "course burn fuel or cause it to combine with the oxygen of the air",
        "and we are thereby provided with large quantities of heat of high",
        "temperature by means of which we may not only warm ourselves and cook",
        "our food but also drive our heatengines using it in fact as a",
        "source of mechanical power",
        "fuel is of two varietieswood and coal now if we consider the origin",
        "of these we shall see that they are produced by the suns rays certain",

        "carbonic acid in the leaves of plants setting free the oxygen while",
        "the carbon is used for the structure or wood of the plant now the",
        "energy of these rays is spent in this process and indeed there",
        "is not enough of such energy left to produce a good photographic",
        "impression of the leaf of a plant because it is all spent in making",
        "wood",
        "we thus see that the energy implied in wood is derived from the suns",
        "rays and the same remark applies to coal indeed the only difference",
        "between wood and coal is one of age wood being recently turned out",
        "from natures laboratory while thousands of years have elapsed since",
        "coal formed the leaves of living plants",
        "198 we are therefore perfectly justified in saying that the energy",
        "of fuel is derived from the suns rays7 coal being the store which",
        "nature has laid up as a species of capital for us while wood is our",
        "precarious yearly income",
        "we are thus at present very much in the position of a young heir who",
        "has only recently come into his estate and who not content with the",
        "income is rapidly squandering his realized property this subject has",
        "been forcibly brought before us by professor jevons who has remarked",
        "that not only are we spending our capital but we are spending the most",

        "have to deduct the amount of energy requisite in order to bring them to",
        "the surface the result is that we must contemplate a time however far",
        "distant when our supplies of coal will be exhausted and we shall be",
        "compelled to resort to other sources of energy",
        "food",
        "199 the energy of food is analogous to that of fuel and serves",
        "similar purposes for just as fuel may be used either for producing",
        "heat or for doing work so food has a twofold office to perform in",
        "the first place by its gradual oxidation it keeps up the temperature",
        "of the body and in the next place it is used as a source of energy",
        "on which to draw for the performance of work thus a man or a horse",
        "that works a great deal requires to eat more food than if he does not",

        "peace",
        "our food may be either of animal or vegetable originif it be the",

        "suns rays but if it be the former the only difference is that it has",
        "passed through the body of an animal before coming to us the animal",
        "has eaten grass and we have eaten the animal",
        "in fact we make use of the animal not only as a variety of nutritious",

        "our present digestive organs",
        "head of water",
        "200 the energy of a head of water like that of fuel and food is",
        "brought about by the suns rays for the sun vaporizes the water",
        "which condensed again in upland districts becomes available as a head",
        "of water",
        "there is however the difference that fuel and food are due to the",
        "actinic power of the suns rays while the evaporation and condensation",
        "of water are caused rather by their heating effect",
        "tidal energy",

        "the fluid portions of our globe the result of this action being a very",
        "gradual stoppage of the energy of rotation of the earth",
        "it is therefore to this motion of rotation that we must look as the",
        "origin of any available energy derived from tidal mills",

        "the earth may as far as we know be wholly composed of matter in its",
        "uncombined form as a source of available energy it is however of no",
        "practical importance",
        "air and water in motion",
        "203 we proceed next to those varieties of available energy which",
        "represent motion the chief of which are air in motion and water in",
        "motion it is owing to the former that the mariner spreads his sail",
        "and carries his vessel from one part of the earths surface to another",
        "and it is likewise owing to the same influence that the windmill grinds",
        "our corn again water in motion is used perhaps even more frequently",
        "than air in motion as a source of motive power",
        "both these varieties of energy are due without doubt to the heating",
        "effect of the suns rays we may therefore affirm that with the",
        "exception of the totally insignificant supply of native sulphur c",
        "and the small number of tidal mills which may be in operation all our",

        "multiplies if the growing cells of the yeastplant be observed under",
        "the microscope it will be seen that the carbonicacid bubbles form",
        "and therefore probably the decomposition of sugar takes place only in",

        "by diastase saccharification is the only one in connection with",

        "thoroughly impressed its importance upon him that he felt embarrassed in",
        "the face of what he used to be strangely enough the first thing that",
        "came to mind was what would the ladye of high degree think if she",

        "together but then the new love of the world and his new tastes came in",

        "something else now",
        "it appeared that the former mission where he had been superintendent had",

        "that he knew not how he dropped it and it shivered into fragments at",
        "his feet on the dull red tiles of the hearth",
        "annoyed beyond measure and wondering why his hand had been so unsteady",

        "servant was a stranger to his ways and that he himself had perhaps",
        "given the man reason to think that it would be acceptable by the very",
        "fact that he had these things among his personal effects then too his",

        "he was glad the hateful beautiful thing was broken it was no ones",
        "fault particularly and now it was out of the way and would not need to",
        "be explained he walked about still humming and looking at his room",
        "and still that picture seemed to follow and be a part of his",
        "consciousness wherever he went it certainly was well hung and gave the",
        "strong impression of being a part of the room itself he looked at it",
        "critically from a new point of view and as he faced it once more he was",
        "in the upper chamber and seemed to hear his master saying yet a little",
        "while and the world seeth me no more and he realized that he was in",
        "the presence of the scene of the end of his masters mission he walked",
        "back to the fireplace seeking for something to turn his thoughts away",
        "and passing the table where stood his elegantly mounted smoking set he",
        "decided to smoke it was about his usual hour for his bedtime smoke",
        "anyway he selected a cigar from those thomas had set out and lighted it",
        "with one of the matches in the silver match safe and for an instant",
        "turned with a feeling of lazy delicious luxury in the use of his new",
        "room and all its appliances unconsciously he seated himself again",
        "before the fire in the great leather chair and began to puff the smoke",
        "into dreamy shapes and let his thoughts wander as he closed his eyes",

        "reach over and touch his hair and laugh lightly he tried to imagine it",
        "but in spite of him the laugh rang out in his thoughts scornfully like a",
        "sharp silver bell that belonged to some one else he glanced over his",
        "shoulder at the imagined face but it looked cold above the smoke she",
        "did not mind smoke he had seen her face behind a wreath of smoke",
        "several times it seemed a natural setting but the dream seemed an",
        "empty one he raised his head and settled it back at a new angle how",
        "rosy the light was as it played on the hearth and how glad he was to be",
        "at home again that was enough for tonight the ladye of high degree",
        "might stay in her home across the sea for this time he was content",
        "then he raised his eyes to the picture above without knowing it and",
        "there he was smoking at the supper table of the lord at least so he",
        "felt it to be he had always been scrupulously careful never to smoke in",
        "or about a church he used to give long earnest lectures on the subject",
        "to some of the boys of the mission who would smoke cigarettes and pipes",
        "on the steps of the church before service he remembered them now with",
        "satisfaction and he also remembered a murmured jeering sound that had",
        "arisen from the corner where the very worst boys sat which had been",
        "suppressed by his friends but which had cut at the time and which he",
        "had always wondered over a little he had seen no inconsistency in",
        "speaking so to the boys in view of his own actions but now as he",
        "looked at that picture he felt as though he were smoking in church with",
        "the service going on the smoke actually hid his masters face he took",
        "down his cigar and looked up with a feeling of apology but this was",
        "involuntary his irritation was rising again the idea of a picture",
        "upsetting him so he must be tired or his nerves unsettled there was no",
        "more harm in smoking in front of that picture than before any other",
        "confound that picture he said as he rose and walked over to the bay",
        "window ill have it hung somewhere else tomorrow i wont have the",
        "thing around no itll have to be left here till after that reception",
        "i suppose but after that it shall go such a consummate nuisance",
        "he stood looking out of the open window with a scowl he reflected that",
        "it was a strange thing for him to be so affected by a picture a mere",
        "imagination of the brain he would not let it be so he would overcome",
        "it then he turned and tramped deliberately up and down that room",
        "smoking away as hard as he could and when he thought his equilibrium",
        "was restored he raised his eyes to the picture as he passed just",
        "casually as any one might who had never thought of it before his eyes",
        "fell and he went on back and forth looking every time at the picture",
        "and every time the eyes of that central figure watched him with that",
        "same sad loving look at last he went to the window again and angrily",
        "threw up the screen threw his halfsmoked cigar far out into the",
        "shrubbery of the garden saying as he did so confound it all",
        "it was the evening before the reception it was growing toward nine",
        "oclock and john stanley had retired to his wing to watch the fire and",
        "consider what a fool he was becoming he had not smoked in that room",
        "since the first night of his return he had not yielded to such weakness",
        "all at once nor with the consent of himself he had thought at first",
        "that he really chose to walk in the garden or smoke on the side piazza",
        "but as the days went by he began to see that he was avoiding his own new",
        "room and it was all because of that picture he glanced revengefully in",
        "the direction where it hung he did not look at it willingly now if he",
        "could help it his elegant smoking set was reposing in the chimney",
        "cupboard locked there with a vicious click of the key by the hand of",
        "the young owner himself and it was not only smoking but other things",
        "that the picture affected there for instance was the pack of cards he",
        "had placed upon the table in their unique case of dainty mosaic design",
        "he had been obliged to put them elsewhere they seemed out of place not",
        "that he felt ashamed of the cards on the contrary he had expected to be",
        "quite proud of the accomplishment of playing well which he had acquired",
        "abroad having never been particularly led in that direction by his",
        "surroundings before he had left home was this room becoming a church",
        "that he could not do as he pleased then there had been a sketch or two",
        "and a bit of statuary which he had brought in his trunk because they",
        "had been overlooked in the packing of the other things that morning he",
        "brought them down to his room but the large picture refused to have",
        "them there there was no harm in the sketches only they did not fit",
        "into the same wall with the great picture there was no harmony in their",
        "themes the statuary was associated with heathenism and wickedness tis",
        "true but it was beautiful and would have looked wonderfully well on the",
        "mantel against the rich dark red of the dull tiles but not under that",
        "picture it was becoming a bondage that picture and after tomorrow",
        "night he would banish it towhere not his bedroom for it would work",
        "its spell there as well",
        "just here there came a tap on the windowsill followed by a hoarse",
        "halfshy whisper",
        "mr stanley ken we come in",
        "he looked up startled the voice had a familiar note in it but he did",
        "not recognize the two tall lank figures outside in the darkness clad",
        "in cheap best clothes and with an air of mingled selfdepreciation and",
        "selfrespect",
        "who is it he asked sharply and suspiciously",

        "to hear he was doing well and living right but he was in no mood to see",
        "him tonight why could he not have waited until tomorrow night when",
        "the others were to come was not that enough but of course he wanted to",
        "get a word of thanks all his own it had been on his tongue to tell joe",
        "he was unusually busy tonight and would he come another time or wait",
        "till tomorrow but the remembrance of the picture made that seem",
        "ungracious he would let them in a few minutes they probably wished to",
        "report that they had seen the picture in the room before the general",
        "view should be given so he unfastened the heavy french plate window and",
        "let the two in turning up as he did so the lights in the room so that",
        "the picture might be seen",
        "they came in lank and awkward as though their best clothes someway",

        "eyes went immediately to the picture it was the way of that picture to",
        "draw all eyes that entered the room and john stanley noted this with",
        "the same growing irritation he had felt all day but over their faces",
        "there grew that softened look of wonder and awe and amaze and to john",
        "stanleys surprise of deepseated answering love to the love in the",
        "eyes of the picture he looked at the picture himself now and his fancy",
        "made it seem that the master was looking at these two well pleased",
        "could it be that he was better pleased with these two ignorant boys than",
        "with him john stanley polished gentleman and cultured christian that",
        "he trusted he was",

        "remembering it all vividly as he had not done before there swept over",
        "him the thrill of delight again that a soul had been saved his heart",
        "long unused to such emotions felt weak and he sat down and motioned",
        "the boys to do the same it would seem that the sight of the picture had",
        "braced up the two to whatever mission theirs had been for their faces",
        "were set in steady purpose though it was evident that this mission was",
        "embarrassing they looked at one another helplessly as if each hoped the",
        "other would begin and at last joe plunged in",
        "mr stanley you ben so good to us we thought twas only fair to you we",
        "should tell you that is we thought youd like it and anyway maybe",
        "you wouldnt take it amiss",

        "joe caught his breath and went on you see she dont know about it",
        "shes heard so much of you and she never heard that not even when they",

        "she had stood looking and thinking for some minutes thus when she heard",
        "a quick step at the door not a sound as of one who had been walking",

        "and how the vision of the ladye of high degree had stood where this",

        "you i cant quite remember and her eyes roved instinctively about",
        "the elegantly furnished room in apparent search for something",
        "he divined her wish at once and courteously went in search of a bible",
        "but in his haste and confusion could not lay his hand upon one",
        "immediately he murmured some apology about not having unpacked all his",

        "to find an empty and unembarrassing room where they might take refuge",

        "forgotten his firm resolution of a few days agone that he would have no",
        "more to do with that mission in any capacity whatever",
        "if this question occurred to him he waived it without excuse he was",
        "pledged to attend the session of the school for the next sabbath anyway",

        "and by and by he gave himself up to contemplating that and he wondered",
        "no longer that the boys had given up many things to please her he would",
        "not find it so very hard to do the same",
        "how earnest she had been what a world of new meaning seemed to be",
