        "individual units yet we feel sure that the globe cannot move itself",
        "as a whole in such a system therefore and indeed in every system",
        "left to itself there may be strong internal forces acting between",
        "the various parts but these actions and reactions are equal and",
        "opposite so that while the small parts whether visible or invisible",
        "are in violent commotion among themselves yet the system as a whole",
        "will remain at rest",
        "in a rifle",
        "13 now it is quite a legitimate step to pass from this instance of the",
        "goldfish to that of a rifle that has just been fired in the former",
        "case we imagined the globe together with its fishes to form one",
        "system and in the latter we must look upon the rifle with its powder",
        "and ball as forming one system also",

        "of a spark although this spark is an external agent yet if we reflect",
        "a little we shall see that its only office in this case is to summon",
        "up the internal forces already existing in the loaded rifle and bring",
        "them into vigorous action and that in virtue of these internal forces",
        "the explosion takes place",
        "the most prominent result of this explosion is the outrush of the",

        "part of a mile before it comes to rest and here it would seem to us",
        "at first sight that the law of equal action and reaction is certainly",
        "broken for these internal forces present in the rifle have at least",
        "propelled part of the system namely the rifle ball with a most",
        "enormous velocity in one direction",
        "14 but a little further reflection will bring to light another",
        "phenomenon besides the outrush of the ball it is well known to all",
        "sportsmen that when a fowlingpiece is discharged there is a kick or",
        "recoil of the piece itself against the shoulder of the sportsman which",
        "he would rather get rid of but which we most gladly welcome as the",
        "solution of our difficulty in plain terms while the ball is projected",
        "forwards the rifle stock if free to move is at the same moment",
        "projected backwards to fix our ideas let us suppose that the rifle",
        "stock weighs 100 ounces and the ball one ounce and that the ball is",
        "projected forwards with the velocity of 1000 feet per second then it",
        "is asserted by the law of action and reaction that the rifle stock is",
        "at the same time projected backwards with the velocity of 10 feet per",
        "second so that the mass of the stock multiplied by its velocity of",
        "recoil shall precisely equal the mass of the ball multiplied by its",
        "velocity of projection the one product forms a measure of the action",
        "in the one direction and the other of the reaction in the opposite",
        "direction and thus we see that in the case of a rifle as well as in",
        "that of the globe of fish action and reaction are equal and opposite",
        "in a falling stone",
        "15 we may even extend the law to cases in which we do not perceive",
        "the recoil or reaction at all thus if i drop a stone from the",
        "top of a precipice to the earth the motion seems all to be in one",
        "direction while at the same time it is in truth the result of a mutual",
        "attraction between the earth and the stone does not the earth move",
        "also we cannot see it move but we are entitled to assert that it",
        "does in reality move upwards to meet the stone although quite to an",
        "imperceptible extent and that the law of action and reaction holds",
        "here as truly as in a rifle the only difference being that in the",
        "one case the two objects are rushing together while in the other",
        "they are rushing apart inasmuch however as the mass of the earth",
        "is very great compared with that of the stone it follows that its",
        "velocity must be extremely small in order that the mass of the earth",
        "multiplied into its velocity upwards shall equal the mass of the",
        "stone multiplied into its velocity downwards",
        "16 we have thus in spite of our ignorance of the ultimate atoms and",
        "molecules of matter arrived at a general law which regulates the",
        "action of internal forces we see that these forces are always mutually",
        "exerted and that if a attracts or repels b b in its turn attracts or",
        "repels a we have here in fact a very good instance of that kind of",
        "generalization which we may arrive at even in spite of our ignorance",
        "of individuals",
        "but having now arrived at this law of action and reaction do we know",
        "all that it is desirable to know have we got a complete understanding",
        "of what takes place in all such casesfor instance in that of the",
        "rifle which is just discharged let us consider this point a little",
        "further",
        "the rifle further considered",
        "17 we define quantity of motion to mean the product of the mass by",
        "the velocity and since the velocity of recoil of the rifle stock",
        "multiplied by the mass of the stock is equal to the velocity of",
        "projection of the rifle ball multiplied by the mass of the ball we",
        "conceive ourselves entitled to say that the quantity of motion or",
        "momentum generated is equal in both directions so that the law of",
        "action and reaction holds here also nevertheless it cannot but occur",
        "to us that in some sense the motion of the rifle ball is a very",
        "different thing from that of the stock for it is one thing to allow",
        "the stock to recoil against your shoulder and discharge the ball into",
        "the air and a very different thing to discharge the ball against your",
        "shoulder and allow the stock to fly into the air and if any man",
        "should assert the absolute equality between the blow of the rifle stock",
        "and that of the rifle ball you might request him to put his assertion",
        "to this practical test with the absolute certainty that he would",
        "decline equality between the twoimpossible why if this were the",
        "case a company of soldiers engaged in war would suffer much more than",
        "the enemy against whom they fired for the soldiers would certainly",
        "feel each recoil while the enemy would suffer from only a small",
        "proportion of the bullets",
        "the rifle ball possesses energy",
        "18 now what is the meaning of this great difference between the two",
        "we have a vivid perception of a mighty difference and it only remains",
        "for us to clothe our naked impressions in a properly fitting scientific",
        "garb",
        "the something which the rifle ball possesses in contradistinction to",
        "the rifle stock is clearly the power of overcoming resistance it",
        "can penetrate through oak wood or through water or alas that it",
        "should be so often tried through the human body and this power of",
        "penetration is the distinguishing characteristic of a substance moving",
        "with very great velocity",
        "19 let us define by the term energy this power which the rifle",
        "ball possesses of overcoming obstacles or of doing work of course",
        "we use the word work without reference to the moral character of the",
        "thing done and conceive ourselves entitled to sum up with perfect",
        "propriety and innocence the amount of work done in drilling a hole",
        "through a deal board or through a man",
        "20 a body such as a rifle ball moving with very great velocity",
        "has therefore energy and it requires very little consideration",
        "to perceive that this energy will be proportional to its weight or",
        "mass for a ball of two ounces moving with the velocity of 1000 feet",
        "per second will be the same as two balls of one ounce moving with this",
        "velocity but the energy of two similarly moving ounce balls will",
        "manifestly be double that of one so that the energy is proportional",
        "to the weight if we imagine that meanwhile the velocity remains the",
        "same",
        "21 but on the other hand the energy is not simply proportional to",
        "the velocity for if it were the energy of the rifle stock and of the",
        "rifle ball would be the same inasmuch as the rifle stock would gain as",
        "much by its superior mass as it would lose by its inferior velocity",
        "therefore the energy of a moving body increases with the velocity more",
        "quickly than a simple proportion so that if the velocity be doubled",
        "the energy is more than doubled now in what manner does the energy",
        "increase with the velocity that is the question we have now to answer",
        "and in doing so we must appeal to the familiar facts of everyday",
        "observation and experience",
        "22 in the first place it is well known to artillerymen that if",
        "a ball have a double velocity its penetrating power or energy is",
        "increased nearly fourfold so that it will pierce through four or",
        "nearly four times as many deal boards as the ball with only a single",
        "velocityin other words they will tell us in mathematical language",
        "that the energy varies as the square of the velocity",
        "definition of work",
        "23 and now before proceeding further it will be necessary to tell",
        "our readers how to measure work in a strictly scientific manner we",
        "have defined energy to be the power of doing work and although every",
        "one has a general notion of what is meant by work that notion may not",
        "be sufficiently precise for the purpose of this volume how then are",
        "we to measure work fortunately we have not far to go for a practical",
        "means of doing this indeed there is a force at hand which enables us",
        "to accomplish this measurement with the greatest precision and this",
        "force is gravity now the first operation in any kind of numerical",
        "estimate is to fix upon our unit or standard thus we say a rod is",
        "so many inches long or a road so many miles long here an inch and",
        "a mile are chosen as our standards in like manner we speak of so",
        "many seconds or minutes or hours or days or years choosing that",
        "standard of time or duration which is most convenient for our purpose",
        "so in like manner we must choose our unit of work but in order to",
        "do so we must first of all choose our units of weight and of length",
        "and for these we will take the kilogramme and the metre these",
        "being the units of the metrical system the kilogramme corresponds",
        "to about 1543235 english grains being rather more than two pounds",
        "avoirdupois and the metre to about 39371 english inches",
        "now if we raise a kilogramme weight one metre in vertical height",
        "we are conscious of putting forth an effort to do so and of being",
        "resisted in the act by the force of gravity in other words we spend",
        "energy and do work in the process of raising this weight",
        "let us agree to consider the energy spent or the work done in this",
        "operation as one unit of work and let us call it the kilogrammetre",
        "24 in the next place it is very obvious that if we raise the",
        "kilogramme two metres in height we do two units of workif three",
        "metres three units and so on",
        "and again it is equally obvious that if we raise a weight of two",
        "kilogrammes one metre high we likewise do two units of work while if",
        "we raise it two metres high we do four units and so on",
        "from these examples we are entitled to derive the following",
        "rulemultiply the weight raised in kilogrammes by the vertical",
        "height in metres through which it is raised and the result will be",

        "relation between velocity and energy",

        "let us next proceed to investigate the relation between velocity and",
        "energy but first let us say a few words about velocity this is one",
        "of the few cases in which everyday experience will aid rather than",
        "hinder us in our scientific conception indeed we have constantly",
        "before us the example of bodies moving with variable velocities",
        "thus a railway train is approaching a station and is just beginning to",
        "slacken its pace when we begin to observe it is moving at the rate of",
        "forty miles an hour a minute afterwards it is moving at the rate of",
        "twenty miles only and a minute after that it is at rest for no two",
        "consecutive moments has this train continued to move at the same rate",
        "and yet we may say with perfect propriety that at such a moment the",
        "train was moving say at the rate of thirty miles an hour we mean of",
        "course that had it continued to move for an hour with the speed which",
        "it had when we made the observation it would have gone over thirty",
        "miles we know that as a matter of fact it did not move for two",
        "seconds at that rate but this is of no consequence and hardly at all",
        "interferes with our mental grasp of the problem so accustomed are we",
        "all to cases of variable velocity",
        "26 let us now imagine a kilogramme weight to be shot vertically",
        "upwards with a certain initial velocitylet us say with the velocity",
        "of 98 metres in one second gravity will of course act against the",
        "weight and continually diminish its upward speed just as in the",
        "railway train the break was constantly reducing the velocity but yet",
        "it is very easy to see what is meant by an initial velocity of 98",
        "metres per second it means that if gravity did not interfere and if",
        "the air did not resist and in fine if no external influence of any",
        "kind were allowed to act upon the ascending mass it would be found to",
        "move over 98 metres in one second",
        "now it is well known to those who have studied the laws of motion",
        "that a body shot upwards with the velocity of 98 metres in one",
        "second will be brought to rest when it has risen 49 metres in height",
        "if therefore it be a kilogramme its upward velocity will have",
        "enabled it to raise itself 49 metres in height against the force of",
        "gravity or in other words it will have done 49 units of work and",
        "we may imagine it when at the top of its ascent and just about to",
        "turn caught in the hand and lodged on the top of a house instead of",
        "being allowed to fall again to the ground we are therefore entitled",
        "to say that a kilogramme shot upwards with the velocity of 98 metres",
        "per second has energy equal to 49 inasmuch as it can raise itself",
        "49 metres in height",
        "27 let us next suppose that the velocity with which the kilogramme",
        "is shot upwards is that of 196 metres per second it is known to all",
        "who have studied dynamics that the kilogramme will now mount not only",
        "twice but four times as high as it did in the last instancein other",
        "words it will now mount 196 metres in height",
        "evidently then in accordance with our principles of measurement",
        "the kilogramme has now four times as much energy as it had in the",
        "last instance because it can raise itself four times as high and",
        "therefore do four times as much work and thus we see that the energy",
        "is increased four times by doubling the velocity",
        "had the initial velocity been three times that of the first instance",
        "or 294 metres per second it might in like manner be shown that the",
        "height attained would have been 441 metres so that by tripling the",
        "velocity the energy is increased nine times",
        "28 we thus see that whether we measure the energy of a moving body by",
        "the thickness of the planks through which it can pierce its way or by",
        "the height to which it can raise itself against gravity the result",
        "arrived at is the same we find the energy to be proportional to the",
        "square of the velocity and we may formularize our conclusion as",

        "m the mass of the body in kilogrammes we shall have the energy in",
        "kilogrammetres  mv196 to test the truth of this formula we have",
        "only to apply it to the cases described in arts 26 and 27",
        "29 we may further illustrate it by one or two examples for instance",
        "let it be required to find the energy contained in a mass of five",
        "kilogrammes shot upwards with the velocity of 20 metres per second",
        "here we have m  5 and v  20 hence",
        "energy  520196  2000196  10204 nearly",
        "again let it be required to find the height to which the mass of the",
        "last question will ascend before it stops we know that its energy is",

        "as the height to which this mass of five kilogrammes must ascend in",
        "order to do work equal to 10204 kilogrammetres",
        "30 in what we have said we have taken no account either of the",
        "resistance or of the buoyancy of the atmosphere in fact we have",
        "supposed the experiments to be made in vacuo or if not in vacuo",
        "made by means of a heavy mass like lead which will be very little",
        "influenced either by the resistance or buoyancy of the air",
        "we must not however forget that if a sheet of paper or a feather",
        "be shot upwards with the velocities mentioned in our text they will",
        "certainly not rise in the air to nearly the height recorded but",
        "will be much sooner brought to a stop by the very great resistance",

        "81 we would next observe that this influence is of two kinds to",

        "one another the two electricities will rush together and unite or",
        "in other words there will be an electric current but it will not be",
        "a momentary but a continuous one and for some time provided these",

        "the magnet in this case the pole of the magnet which points to the",
        "north will always be deflected by the current towards your right",
        "hand the strength of a current may be measured by the amount of the",
        "deflection it produces upon a magnetic needle and the instrument by",
        "which this measurement is made is called a galvanometer",
        "97 in the next place the current is able not merely to deflect",
        "a magnet but also to render soft iron magnetic let us take for",
        "instance the wire connected with the one pole of the battery and",
        "cover it with thread in order to insulate it and let us wrap this",

        "power of decomposing compound substances under certain conditions",
        "suppose for instance that the poles of a battery instead of being",
        "brought together are plunged into a vessel of water decomposition",

        "although parallel convey currents going in opposite directions they",
        "will then repel one another a good way of showing this experimentally",
        "is to cause two circular currents to float on water if these currents",
        "both go either in the same direction as the hands of a watch or in",
        "the opposite direction then the two will attract one another but if",

        "near each other the circular currents which face each other are then",
        "all going in the same direction and the two will therefore attract",

        "thread and placed near each other let both the extremities of the",

        "us to detect the smallest current of electricity which may pass through",
        "this coil now it is found that when we first connect the righthand",
        "coil so as to pass the battery current through it a momentary current",
        "will pass through the lefthand coil and will deflect the needle of",
        "the galvanometer but this current will go in an opposite direction to",
        "that which circulates round the righthand coil",
        "103 again as long as the current continues to flow through the",
        "righthand coil there will be no current through the other but at",
        "the moment of breaking the contact between the righthand coil and",
        "the battery there will again be a momentary current in the lefthand",
        "coil but this time in the same direction as that of the righthand",
        "coil instead of being as before in the opposite direction in other",
        "words when contact is made in the righthand coil there is a",
        "momentary current in the lefthand coil but in an opposite direction",
        "to that in the right while when contact is broken in the righthand",
        "coil there is a momentary current in the lefthand coil in the same",
        "direction as that in the right",
        "104 in order to exemplify this induction of currents it is not even",
        "necessary to make and break the current in the righthand coil for we",
        "may keep it constantly going and arrange so as to make the righthand",
        "coil always retaining its connection with the battery alternately",
        "approach and recede from the other when it approaches the other the",

        "coil the inductive effect will be precisely the same for in both",
